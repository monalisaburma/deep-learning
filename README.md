# Object Detection using TensorFlow 2.0

## Overview

This project implements custom object detection using TensorFlow 2.0. The goal is to detect objects in images using a pre-trained model and perform inference on new images.

## Project Structure

- **TFOD 2.0 custom_object_detection.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **TensorFlow Installation:**
   - Ensure TensorFlow 2.x is installed. If not, install it using `pip install tensorflow`.

2. **Clone TensorFlow Models Repository:**
   - Clone the TensorFlow Models repository with essential scripts and libraries for object detection.

3. **Install Protobuf and COCO API:**
   - Install Protobuf for data serialization.
   - Clone and install the COCO API for object detection tasks.

4. **Install Object Detection API:**
   - Copy the setup.py file and install the Object Detection API.

5. **Download Pre-trained Model:**
   - Navigate to the pre-trained models directory and download a pre-trained model.

6. **Train and Export Model:**
   - Train the model on your dataset and export the trained model for inference.

7. **Inferencing on New Images:**
   - Run inference on new images using the trained model.

## Usage

For detailed instructions and code, refer to the Jupyter Notebook `TFOD 2.0 custom_object_detection.ipynb`.
